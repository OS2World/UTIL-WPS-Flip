 Flip flips your PM screen, if you have Warp and DIVE (OS/2 Multimedia)
installed.

 You can control the number of frames with a command line argument (i.e.
'flip 200' shows 200 frames of the screen being flipped).  The default
is 50 frames.

 I have written this little program on a lazy saturday morning, and I
would like to share it with you (source and all), in hope you can write
some more good Warp software.

 The idea of flip is based on a program that behaved exactly in the same
way (and was called in exactly the same way) before DIVE became the
standard for direct video access.  It, too, contained full sources.  But
I had trashed it because it didn't work with DIVE (to say: these source
are original).

 The bank switching code is derived partially from the SHOW program in
the Warp Toolkit.

 I wrote this program using the IBM C-Set++ v2.1 compiler, but you
should be able to use any other compiler, if you have the Warp Toolkit.

 So, please do whatever you like with this software, but don't blame me
if anything goes wrong.  I'd like being credited in any code based on
this or in a repackaged zip-file.

 In any event I'd like to hear any comments or problems from you.

 My e-mail address is: duncan@mclink.it.

 Have fun.
